%Description
BusyBox is a suite of "tiny" Unix utilities in a multi-call binary. It
provides a pretty complete POSIX environment in a very small package.
Just add a kernel, "ash" (Keith Almquists tiny Bourne shell clone), and
an editor such as "elvis-tiny" or "ae", and you have a full system. This
is makes an excellent environment for a "rescue" disk or any small or
embedded system.
