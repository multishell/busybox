Author: mjn3
Branch: HEAD
Tag: (none) 
Log:
Rewrite parse_config_file().  Among the old version's problems:
  No checking for lines that were too long.
  No checking that fgets returning NULL was actually due to EOF.
  Various whitespace handling inconsistencies.
  Bloat (switches and multiple identical function calls).
  Failure to check for trailing characters in some cases.
  Dynamicly allocated memory was not free()d on error.
Given that this controls suid/sgid behavior, the sloppy coding was
really inexcusable.  :-(

Author: andersen
Branch: HEAD
Tag: (none) 
Log:
The variable 'complementaly' used to be allocated with calloc, which zeroed it
out during the allocation process.  When vodz changed it to be allocated on the
stack, he forgot to explicitly zero it, leaving its value filled with whatever
used to be sitting on the stack.  It would garbage values, depending on the
garbage that happened to be sitting on the stack when the function was called.
The result was that applets using bb_getopt_ulflags() were showing
unpredictable behavior (such as segfaults), which naturally broke many things.

While building glibc with busybox as part of the development environment, I
found a bug in glibc's regexec can throw sed into an endless loop.  This
fixes it.  Should I put an #ifdef around it or something?  (Note, this patch
also contains the "this is not gnu sed 4.0" hack I posted earlier, which is
also needed to build glibc...)

Hello,

when calling seq with

    seq 1 1

it generates an "endless" list of numbers until the counter wraps and
reaches 1 again. The follwoing small patch should introduce the
expected behavior (output of 1 and termination):

regards,
Jean

Hi,

   When httpd connection is closed, bosybox httpd will
not stop reading from CGI program. This patch fix this
problem. It check the return value of bb_full_write and
stop reading from CGI if the connection is closed.
Please apply this patch.

Hi,

I've noticed the bug also, and here is another patch for it. I hope it'll
not introduce more bugs. Not too nice, but works for me.

Here it is for busybox-1.00-pre6
