BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for most of the utilities
you usually find in fileutils, shellutils, findutils, textutils, grep, gzip,
tar, etc. BusyBox provides a fairly complete POSIX environment for any small or
emdedded system. The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options then
their full featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included provide
the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts.

BusyBox has been written with size-optimization and limited resources in mind.
It is also extremely modular so you can easily include or exclude commands (or
features) at compile time. This makes it easy to customize your embedded
systems. To create a working system, just add a kernel, a shell (such as ash),
and an editor (such as elvis-tiny or ae).

Busybox was originally written to support the Debian Rescue/Install disks, but
it also makes an excellent environment for any small or embedded system.

As of version 0.20 there is a version number. : ) Also as of version 0.20,
BusyBox is now modularized to easily allow you to build only the components you
need, thereby reducing binary size. To turn off unwanted Busybox components,
simply edit the file "Config.h" and comment out the components you do not
need using C++ style (//) comments.

After the build is complete a busybox.links file is generated which is then
used by 'make install' to create symlinks to the busybox binary for all
compiled in functions.  By default, 'make install' will place the symlink
forest into `pwd`/_install unless you have defined the PREFIX environment
variable (i.e. make PREFIX="/tmp/foo" install)
