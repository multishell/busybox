BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for most of the utilities
you usually find in fileutils, shellutils, findutils, textutils, grep, gzip,
tar, etc. BusyBox provides a fairly complete POSIX environment for any small or
embedded system. The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than
their full featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included provide
the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts.
<p>
BusyBox has been written with size-optimization and limited resources in mind.
It is also extremely modular so you can easily include or exclude commands (or
features) at compile time. This makes it easy to customize your embedded
systems. To create a working system, just add /dev, a kernel, and a shell.
For a really minimal system, you can even use the busybox shell (not Bourne compatible, but very small and quite usable), and the busybox vi editor.
<p>

BusyBox is now maintained by 
<a href="http://codepoet.org/andersen/erik/erik.html">
Erik Andersen</a>, and its ongoing development is being sponsored by 
<a href="http://www.lineo.com/">Lineo</a>.

    <li> <b>7 July 2001 -- BusyBox 0.52 released</b>
    <br>

	     I am very pleased to announce the immediate availability of
	     BusyBox 0.52 (the "new-and-improved rock-solid release").  This
	     release is the result of <em>many</em> hours of work and has tons
	     of bugfixes, optimizations, and cleanups.  This release adds
	     several new applets, including several new shells (such as hust, msh,
	     and ash).

	     <p>
	     The 
	     <a href="ftp://oss.lineo.com/busybox/Changelog">changelog</a> covers 
	     some of the more obvious details, but there are many many things that
	     are not mentioned, but have been improved in subtle ways.  As usual,
	     BusyBox 0.52 can be downloaded from 
	     <a href="ftp://oss.lineo.com/busybox">ftp://oss.lineo.com/busybox</a>.
	     <p>Have Fun!
	     <p>


	<li> <b>10 April 2001 - Graph of Busybox Growth </b>
	<br> 
	The illustrious Larry Doolittle has made a PostScript chart of the growth
	of the Busybox tarball size over time. It is available for downloading /
	viewing <a href= "busybox-growth.ps"> right here</a>.

	<p> (Note that while the number of applets in Busybox has increased, you
	can still configure Busybox to be as small as you want by selectively
	turning off whichever applets you don't need.)
	<p>

    <li> <b>10 April 2001 -- BusyBox 0.51 released</b>
    <br>

	     BusyBox 0.51 (the "rock-solid release") is now out there.  This
	     release adds only 2 new applets: env and vi.  The vi applet,
	     contributed by Sterling Huxley, is very functional, and is only
	     22k.  This release fixes 3 critical bugs in the 0.50 release.
	     There were 2 potential segfaults in lash (the busybox shell) in
	     the 0.50 release which are now fixed.  Another critical bug in
	     0.50 which is now fixed: syslogd from 0.50 could potentially
	     deadlock the init process and thereby break your entire system.
	     <p>

	     There are a number of improvements in this release as well.  For
	     one thing, the wget applet is greatly improved.  Dmitry Zakharov
	     added FTP support, and Laurence Anderson make wget fully RFC
	     compliant for HTTP 1.1.  The mechanism for including utility
	     functions in previous releases was clumsy and error prone.  Now
	     all utility functions are part of a new libbb library, which makes
	     maintaining utility functions much simpler.  And BusyBox now
	     compiles on itanium systems (thanks to the Debian itanium porters
	     for letting me use their system!).
	     <p>
	     You can read the 
	     <a href="ftp://oss.lineo.com/busybox/Changelog">changelog</a> for
	     complete details.  BusyBox 0.51 can be downloaded from 
	     <a href="ftp://oss.lineo.com/busybox">ftp://oss.lineo.com/busybox</a>.
	     <p>Have Fun!
	     <p>

    <li> <b>Busybox Boot-Floppy Image</b>

    <p>Because you asked for it, we have made available a <a href=
    "ftp://opensource.lineo.com/busybox/busybox.floppy.img"> Busybox boot floppy
    image</a>. Here's how you use it:

    <ol>

	    <li> <a href= "ftp://opensource.lineo.com/busybox/busybox.floppy.img">
	    Download the image</a>

	    <li> dd it onto a floppy like so: <tt> dd if=busybox.floppy.img
	    of=/dev/fd0 ; sync </tt>

	    <li> Pop it in a machine and boot up.

    </ol>

    <p> If you want to look at the contents of the initrd image, do this:

    <pre>
	    mount ./busybox.floppy.img /mnt -o loop -t msdos        
	    cp /mnt/initrd.gz /tmp                          
	    umount /mnt           
	    gunzip /tmp/initrd.gz
	    mount /tmp/initrd /mnt -o loop -t minix
    </pre>


    <li> <b>15 March 2001 -- BusyBox 0.50 released</b>
    <br>

	     This release adds several new applets including ifconfig, route, pivot_root, stty,
	     and tftp, and also fixes tons of bugs.  Tab completion in the
	     shell is now working very well, and the shell's environment variable
	     expansion was fixed.   Tons of other things were fixed or made
	     smaller.  For a fairly complete overview, see the 
	     <a href="ftp://oss.lineo.com/busybox/Changelog">changelog</a>.
	     <p>
	     lash (the busybox shell) is still with us, fixed up a bit so it
	     now behaves itself quite nicely.  It really is quite usable as
	     long as you don't expect it to provide Bourne shell grammer.
	     Standard things like pipes, redirects, command line editing, and
	     environment variable expansion work great.  But we have found that
	     this shell, while very usable, does not provide an extensible
	     framework for adding in full Bourne shell behavior.  So the first order of
	     business as we begin working on the next BusyBox release will be to merge in the new shell
	     currently in progress at 
	     <a href="http://doolittle.faludi.com/~larry/parser.html">Larry Doolittle's website</a>.   
	     <p>


    <li> <b>27 January 2001 -- BusyBox 0.49 released</b>
    <br>

	     Several new applets, lots of bug fixes, cleanups, and many smaller 
	     things made nicer.  Several cleanups and improvements to the shell.
	     For a list of the most interesting changes 
	     you might want to look at the <a href="ftp://oss.lineo.com/busybox/Changelog">changelog</a>. 
	     <p>
	     Special thanks go out to Matt Kraai and Larry Doolittle for all their
	     work on this release, and for keeping on top of things while I've been 
	     out of town.
	     <p>
	     <em>Special Note</em><br>

	     BusyBox 0.49 was supposed to have replaced lash, the BusyBox
	     shell, with a new shell that understands full Bourne shell/Posix shell grammer.
	     Well, that simply didn't happen in time for this release.  A new
	     shell that will eventually replace lash is already under
	     construction.  This new shell is being developed by Larry
	     Doolittle, and could use all of our help.  Please see the work in
	     progress on <a href="http://doolittle.faludi.com/~larry/parser.html">Larry's website</a> 
	     and help out if you can.  This shell will be included in the next 
	     release of BusyBox.
	     <p>

    <li> <b>13 December 2000 -- BusyBox 0.48 released</b>
    <br>

	     This release fixes lots and lots of bugs.  This has had some very
	     rigorous testing, and looks very, very clean.  The usual tar
	     update of course: tar no longer breaks hardlinks, tar -xzf is
	     optionally supported, and the LRP folks will be pleased to know
	     that 'tar -X' and 'tar --exclude' are both now in.  Applets are
	     now looked up using a binary search making lash (the busybox
	     shell) much faster.  For the new debian-installer (for Debian
	     woody) a .udeb can now be generated.  
	     <p>
	     The curious can get a list of some of the more interesting changes by reading 
	     the <a href="ftp://oss.lineo.com/busybox/Changelog">changelog</a>. 
	     <p>
	     Many thanks go out to the many many people that have contributed to 
	     this release, especially Matt Kraai, Larry Doolittle, and Kent Robotti.
	     <p>
