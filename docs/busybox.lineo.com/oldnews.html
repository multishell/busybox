    <hr>

    <p> <li> <b>11 July 2000 -- BusyBox 0.46 released</b>
    <br>

	     This release fixes several bugs (including a ugly bug in tar,
	     and fixes for NFSv3 mount support).  Added a dumpkmap to allow 
	     people to dump a binary keymaps for use with 'loadkmap', and a
	     completely reworked 'grep' and 'sed' which should behave better.
	     BusyBox shell can now also be used as a login shell.
	     See the <a href="ftp://oss.lineo.com/busybox/Changelog">changelog</a> 
	     for complete details.


    <p> <li> <b>21 June 2000 -- BusyBox 0.45 released</b>
    <br>

	     This release has been slow in coming, but is very solid at this
	     point.  BusyBox now supports libc5 as well as GNU libc.  This
	     release provides the following new apps: cut, tr, insmod, ar,
	     mktemp, setkeycodes, md5sum, uuencode, uudecode, which, and
	     telnet.  There are bug fixes for just about every app as well (see
	     the <a href="ftp://oss.lineo.com/busybox/Changelog">changelog</a> for
	     details).
	     <p>
	     Also, some exciting infrastructure news!  Busybox now has its own 
	     <a href="http://opensource.lineo.com/lists/busybox/">mailing list</a>, 
	     publically browsable
	     <a href="http://opensource.lineo.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb/busybox/">CVS tree</a>,  
	     anonymous
	     <a href="http://opensource.lineo.com/cvs_anon.html">CVS access</a>, and
	     for those that are actively contributing there is even 
	     <a href="http://opensource.lineo.com/cvs_write.html">CVS write access</a>.
	     I think this will be a huge help to the ongoing development of BusyBox.
	     <p>
	     Also, for the curious, there is no 0.44 release.  Somehow 0.44 got announced
	     a few weeks ago prior to its actually being released.  To avoid any confusion
	     we are just skipping 0.44.
	     <p>
	     Many thanks go out to the many people that have contributed to this release
	     of BusyBox (esp. Pavel Roskin)!


    <p> <li> <b>19 April 2000 -- syslogd bugfix</b>
    <br>
        Turns out that there was still a bug in busybox syslogd.
	For example, with the following test app:
<pre>
	#include &lt;syslog.h&gt;

	int do_log(char* msg, int delay)
	{
	    openlog("testlog", LOG_PID, LOG_DAEMON);
	    while(1) {
	        syslog(LOG_ERR, "%s: testing one, two, three\n", msg);
	        sleep(delay);
	    }
	    closelog();
	    return(0);
	};

	int main(void)
	{
	    if (fork()==0)
	        do_log("A", 2);
	    do_log("B", 3);
	}
</pre>
	it should be logging stuff from both "A" and "B".  As released in 0.43 only stuff
	from "A" would have been logged.  This means that if init tries to log something
	while say ppp has the syslog open, init would block (which is bad, bad, bad).
	<p>
	Karl M. Hegbloom has created a 
	<a href="ftp://ftp.lineo.com/pub/busybox/busybox-0.43-syslog_patch">fix for the problem</a>.
	Thanks Karl!


    <p> <li> <b>18 April 2000 -- BusyBox 0.43 released (finally!)</b>
    <br>
        I have finally gotten everything into a state where I feel pretty
	good about things.  This is definitely the most stable, solid release
	so far.  A lot of bugs have been fixed, and the following new apps
	have been added: sh, basename, dirname, killall, uptime, 
	freeramdisk, tr, echo, test, and usleep.  Tar has been completely
	rewritten from scratch.  Bss size has also been greatly reduced.
	More details are available in the 
	<a href="ftp://ftp.lineo.com/pub/busybox/Changelog">changelog</a>.
	Oh, and as a special bonus, I wrote some fairly comprehensive
	<em>documentation</em>, complete with examples and full usage information.

	<p>
	Many thanks go out to the fine people that have helped by submitting patches
	and bug reports; particularly instrumental in helping for this release were 
	Karl Hegbloom, Pavel Roskin, Friedrich Vedder, Emanuele Caratti,
	Bob Tinsley, Nicolas Pitre, Avery Pennarun, Arne Bernin, John Beppu, and Jim Gleason.
	There were others so if I somehow forgot to mention you, I'm very sorry.
	<p>

	You can grab BusyBox 0.43 tarballs <a href="ftp://ftp.lineo.com/pub/busybox/">here</a>.

    <p> <li> <b>9 April 2000 -- BusyBox 0.43 pre release</b>
    <br>
        Unfortunately, I have not yet finished all the things I want to
        do for BusyBox 0.43, so I am posting this pre-release for people
        to poke at.  This contains my complete rewrite of tar, which now weighs in at
        5k (7k with all options turned on) and works for reading and writing
        tarballs (which it does correctly for everything I have been able to throw
        at it).  Tar also (optionally) supports the "--exclude" option (mainly because
        the Linux Router Project folks asked for it).  This also has a pre-release
        of the micro shell I have been writing.  This pre-release should be stable
        enough for production use -- it just isn't a release since I have some structural
        changes I still want to make.
        <p>
	The pre-release can be found <a href="ftp://ftp.lineo.com/pub/busybox/">here</a>.
	Please let me know ASAP if you find <em>any</em> bugs.
    
    <p> <li> <b>28 March 2000 -- Andersen Baby Boy release</b>
    <br>
	I am pleased to announce that on Tuesday March 28th at 5:48pm, weighing in at 7
	lbs. 12 oz, Micah Erik Andersen was born at LDS Hospital here in Salt Lake City.
	He was born in the emergency room less then 5 minutes after we arrived -- and
	it was such a relief that we even made it to the hospital at all.  Despite the
	fact that I was driving at an amazingly unlawful speed and honking at everybody
	and thinking decidedly unkind thoughts about the people in our way, my wife
	(inconsiderate of my feelings and complete lack of medical training) was lying
	down in the back seat saying things like "I think I need to start pushing now"
	(which she then proceeded to do despite my best encouraging statements to the
	contrary).
	<p>
	Anyway, I'm glad to note that despite the much-faster-than-we-were-expecting
	labor, both Shaunalei and our new baby boy are doing wonderfully.
	<p>
	So now that I am done with my excuse for the slow release cycle...
	Progress on the next release of BusyBox has been slow but steady.  I expect
	to have a release sometime during the first week of April.  This release will
	include a number of important changes, including the addition of a shell, a 
	re-write of tar (to accommodate the Linux Router Project), and syslogd can now
	accept multiple concurrent connections, fixing lots of unexpected blocking 
	problems.


    <p> <li> <b>11 February 2000 -- BusyBox 0.42 released</b>
    <br>

	     This is the most solid BusyBox release so far.  Many, many
		bugs have been fixed.   See the 
<a href="ftp://ftp.lineo.com/pub/busybox/Changelog">changelog</a> for details.

		Of particular interest, init will now cleanly unmount 
		filesystems on reboot, cp and mv have been rewritten and 
		behave much better, and mount and umount no longer leak 
		loop devices.  Many thanks go out to Randolph Chung, 
		Karl M. Hegbloom, Taketoshi Sano, and Pavel Roskin for 
		their hard work on this release of BusyBox.  Please pound 
		on it and let me know if you find any bugs.

    <p> <li> <b>19 January 2000 -- BusyBox 0.41 released</b>
    <br>

	     This release includes bugfixes to cp, mv, logger, true, false,
		mkdir, syslogd, and init.  New apps include wc, hostid, 
		logname, tty, whoami, and yes.  New features include loop device
		support in mount and umount, and better TERM handling by init.
		The changelog can be found <a href="ftp://ftp.lineo.com/pub/busybox/Changelog">here</a>.

    <p> <li> <b>7 January 2000 -- BusyBox 0.40 released</b>
    <br>

	     This release includes bugfixes to init (now includes inittab support),
	     syslogd, head, logger, du, grep, cp, mv, sed, dmesg, ls, kill, gunzip, and mknod.
	     New apps include sort, uniq, lsmod, rmmod, fbset, and loadacm.
	     In particular, this release fixes an important bug in tar which 
	     in some cases produced serious security problems.
	     As always, the changelog can be found <a href="ftp://ftp.lineo.com/pub/busybox/Changelog">here</a>.

    <p> <li> <b>11 December 1999 -- BusyBox Website</b>
    <br>
	     I have received permission from Bruce Perens (the original author of BusyBox)
		to set up this site as the new primary website for BusyBox.  This website
		will always contain pointers to the latest and greatest, and will also 
		contain the latest documentation on how to use BusyBox, what it can do,
		what arguments its apps support, etc.

    <p> <li> <b>10 December 1999 -- BusyBox 0.39 released</b>
    <br>
	     This release includes fixes to init, reboot, halt, kill, and ls, and contains 
	     the new apps ping, hostname, mkfifo, free, tail, du, tee, and head.  A full
	     changelog can be found <a href="ftp://ftp.lineo.com/pub/busybox/Changelog">here</a>.
    <p> <li> <b>5 December 1999 -- BusyBox 0.38 released</b>
    <br>
	     This release includes fixes to tar, cat, ls, dd, rm, umount, find, df, 
		and make install, and includes new apps syslogd/klogd and logger.
