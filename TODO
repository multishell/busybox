TODO list for busybox in no particular order. Just because something
is listed here doesn't mean that it is going to be added to busybox,
or that doing so is even a good idea. It just means that I _might_ get
around to it some time. If you have any good ideas, please let me know.

* login/sulogin/passwd/getty/etc are part of tinylogin, and so are not
    needed or wanted in busybox (or else I'd have to link in libcrypt).

* Networking apps are probably going to be split out some time soon into a
    separate package (named perhaps tiny-netkit?).  This currently includes 
    hostid, hostname, mnc, and ping.
