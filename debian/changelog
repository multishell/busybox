busybox (0.45-1) frozen; urgency=low

  * First attempt at packaging BusyBox as a .deb.  This has been in 
    in the Debian boot-floppies CVS tree forever.  Hopefully, having it as a
    standalone app will make life easier for me, the debian-installer team, and
    everyone else as well...
  * I have created a busybox-static that can be used as a rescue shell when you 
    hose your system.  Just invoke "busybox sh" to fir up the shell.  This has
    every app provided by busybox staically linked in.  There have been several
    times in the past that I would have loved to have this sitting on my system
    (i.e. when libc gets screwed up.)
